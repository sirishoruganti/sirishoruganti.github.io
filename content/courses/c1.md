## Introduction

This course covers research topics related to unemployment. It discusses models used to describe unemployment, and policies used to tackle unemployment. It tries to answer several questions: 

+ Why does unemployment exist? 
+ Why does unemployment vary over the business cycle? 
+ What is the socially optimal level of unemployment? 
+ How should labor market policies respond to fluctuations in unemployment?

Being unemployed makes you unhappy, and having unemployment in your country makes you unhappy. In fact, they find after controlling for income and other personal characteristics that becoming unemployed is as painful as divorcing.

## Labor market facts and matching function

This section reviews basic facts about the labor market and unemployment in the United States. We then introduce the matching function—the main tool that we will use to model the labor market and unemployment. The matching function summarizes the complex process through which workers searching for jobs and firms searching for employees meet each other.

## Matching model of the labor market

This section introduces the matching model of the labor market. This is the model that we will use to study unemployment and labor market policies in this course. The model was developed by Peter Diamond, Dale Mortensen, and Christopher Pissarides in the 1980s—for this they received a Nobel Prize in 2010. In the matching model, unlike in the neoclassical model, all trades are mediated by a matching function. Nevertheless, we can construct labor supply and labor demand curves, and use them to solve the matching model.

## Wage functions

This section discuss the labor market institutions that determine wages—such as unions, the minimum wage, and corporate policies. It then discusses various wage functions that can be used in the matching model to describe wages in worker-firm relationships—such as fixed wages, rigid wages, and bargained wages.

## Unemployment fluctuations

This section discusses unemployment fluctuations in the matching model. We first show that the model with rigid wages generates realistic fluctuations in unemployment. We then show that the model with bargained wages is unable to generate such fluctuations. The reason is that bargained wages are too flexible.

## Frictional and rationing unemployment

This section turns to the sources of unemployment over the business cycle. In usual matching models, unemployment becomes vanishingly small when unemployed workers search sufficiently hard for jobs. Unemployment also becomes vanishingly small when recruiting costs are sufficiently low. In other words, usual matching models do not feature job rationing. Such lack of job rationing is difficult to reconcile with the long queues of unemployed workers at job bureaus and factory gates observed during the Great Depression. 

The section then develops a matching model with job rationing. In this model, in recession, jobs are lacking, so some unemployment remains even if workers are desperate to find a job. The model features both frictional unemployment—caused by difficulties in matching workers and firms—and rationing unemployment—caused by a lack of job. The model describes well good and bad times. In bad times, labor demand is low so rationing unemployment is high. Hence total unemployment is high. But, maybe surprisingly, frictional unemployment is low. In that case, workers queue for jobs and it is easy for firms to fill vacancies. Conversely, in good times, labor demand is high so rationing unemployment is low and total unemployment is low. Frictional unemployment is higher than in bad times. In that case, it is easy for workers to find jobs but firms struggle to fill vacancies.

Technically, typical matching models do not feature job rationing because their labor demand is perfectly elastic with respect to wages and labor market tightness. Once we introduce a labor demand that is downward sloping with respect to wages and tightness into the matching model, job rationing appears and not all unemployment is frictional. The easiest way to generate a downward-sloping labor demand is by assuming that the production function has diminishing marginal returns to labor.

+ [Michaillat (2012)](/1/) – This paper establishes that usual matching models do not have job rationing and develops a matching model with job rationing. In this model all fluctuations are caused by shocks to labor productivity. This is because the model is in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides tradition: it only features a labor market, so there is no scope for aggregate-demand shocks.
+ [Michaillat, Saez (2015)](/3/) – This paper extends the model in Michaillat (2012) by introducing an aggregate demand. This is done by adding to the labor market a product market with a similar matching structure. Aggregate demand shocks generate fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies along the Beveridge curve.

## Efficient unemployment and unemployment gap


Unlike in neoclassical models, in matching models there is no guarantee of efficiency. The prevailing unemployment rate is generally inefficient: either too high or too low.

This section defines and computes the socially efficient rate of unemployment in the matching model. It then extends the analysis to all models with a Beveridge curve—not only the matching model. It develops measures of the efficient labor market tightness and efficient unemployment rate. It also develops a measure of the unemployment gap to assess how far the unemployment rate is from its socially efficient level. The measure depends on three sufficient statistics: recruiting cost, social value of nonwork, and elasticity of the Beveridge curve.

The section finally shows that in the United States, the unemployment gap is generally positive, and it is sharply countercyclical. This means that the US labor market is generally inefficiently slack and especially inefficiently slack in slumps. For instance, the unemployment gap reached 6 percentage points during the Volcker Recession and the Great Recession.

## Labor-demand policies

Over the business cycle, fluctuations in labor demand generate fluctuations in unemployment that are inefficient. Labor market policies that can influence labor demand should therefore counterbalance these fluctuations and bring the unemployment rate closer to its efficient level. This section discusses how minimum wage, payroll tax, and public employment—all policies that directly influence labor demand—should respond to unemployment fluctuations over the business cycle.

## Unemployment insurance

Fluctuations in unemployment raise another policy question: how should the generosity of unemployment insurance respond to unemployment fluctuations? This question was hotly debated during the Great Recession. Some argued that unemployment insurance should be reduced because it discouraged job search and would raise unemployment further. Other countered that unemployment insurance could be increased without raising unemployment much—as there were no jobs available for jobseekers.

This section weights the two sides of the argument. It discusses the different channels through which unemployment insurance affects the labor market. It then derives a formula for optimal unemployment insurance. The formula contrasts how generous unemployment insurance should be in good times and in bad times. The formula shows that the generosity of unemployment insurance should be adjusted over the business cycle; the adjustment depends on how unemployment insurance affects labor market tightness. The effect of unemployment insurance on tightness depends on the model: increasing unemployment insurance may raise tightness by alleviating the rat race for jobs or lower tightness by increasing wages through bargaining.

In the United  States, unemployment insurance is more generous in bad times than in good times. The formula, combined with evidence from the US labor market, suggests that such countercyclical generosity is desirable. The reasons are that increasing unemployment insurance appear to raise labor market tightness, and that labor market tightness is inefficiently low in slumps and inefficiently high in booms.
