## Overview

The source code to this website is publicly available as a template repository, so anyone can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files, and quickly create their own academic website. The code might also be helpful to anyone who wishes to recreate specific features of this website. 

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which is a very fast, open-source static website generator. The website design is based on [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), which is a minimalist, fast, and flexible Hugo theme. The theme design has been customized for academic websites. The first goal was to obtain a minimalist website that is easy to navigate, fast to load, and easy to maintain. The second goal was to obtain a website that focuses on the research and teaching material.

### Tags and archive

Two automatically generated lists are added to the website:

+ [Tags](https://pascalmichaillat.org/tags/) – List of all the keywords for papers and courses
+ [Archive](https://pascalmichaillat.org/archive/) – Chronological list of all papers, courses, and design projects
